# color-gradient

Function that computes the color gradient.

It receives both a three-dimensional array (red, green and blue coordinates) and a color increment, and updates the colors accordingly.

Works on C++, but it should not be really hard to make it work on other languages, since the function performs basic operations.

## Examples on OpenGL

- Example of the output starting at red with `colorIncrement = 0.5`:
